# GAROLD'S BLOG

**A Digital Sanctuary for Thoughts.**

This is not just another blog. It is a minimalist writing environment designed for focus, clarity, and aesthetic pleasure. Built with a "Zero-Dependency" philosophy for the core runtime, ensuring lightning-fast performance and absolute control over the visual experience.

## PHILOSOPHY

**Minimal Luxury**
We believe that digital tools should be beautiful. The interface draws inspiration from high-end editorial layouts and the MNTN design system—utilizing deep, resonant colors (Dark Blue / Gold) and crisp, serif typography to elevate the writing experience.

**Privacy First**
Your thoughts are yours. With the integrated Privacy Shield, you can lock the interface instantly. Whether stepping away from your desk or simply needing a moment of privacy, your content remains secure behind a PIN-protected overlay.

## CORE FEATURES

**The Canvas**
A distraction-free, full-screen editor powered by Quill.js, customized to strip away the noise. It supports rich text, code blocks, and seamless image handling without cluttering the UI.

**Privacy Shield**
An integrated screen lock system.
- Secure 4-digit or 6-digit PIN protection.
- Auto-lock capability based on inactivity (customizable timer).
- Visual obfuscation (Opaque overlay) preventing prying eyes.

**Adaptive Aesthetics**
- **Luxe Dark**: A deep, reliable environment for night work or focused writing.
- **Paper Light**: A crisp, high-contrast mode for clarity and day-time editing.
